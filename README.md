# YTMusic-Migrate

Tool to copy playlists, likes, and saved albums from one YT Music account to another.

## Installation

You need Python 3.10 or newer.

This tool makes use of [ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi), which can be installed from PyPI:

`pip install ytmusicapi`

Usage

After that, you can use the menu to perform copy and remove operations.

Credits
All credits to the original creator of this tool. The original script was created by RaduTek.

I have made some changes to make the script functional now, but all the credit goes to the original author for their work and contribution.
